# 3D-Fitting
Functions created for the use of fitting 3D cartesian point data to 3D models. 

Spherefit.m : Fits raw data to a sphere. Relies on qrDataPrep.m and backsub4x4.m
qrDataFit.m : Takes an N-by-3 Matrix with Raw Coordinate Data and Produces a QR decomposable form of the data. 
backsub4x4.m : Performs back substitution on a 4x4 Matrix. 

planefit.m : Fits a data set to a plane using Least Squares Regression. Returns the error metric.

Originally produced for CISC 271, Scientific Computing, at Queen's University. This has since been further adapted and changed for other usages.
